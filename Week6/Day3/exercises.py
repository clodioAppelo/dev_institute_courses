# Exercise 1 : Favorite Numbers
# Instructions
# Create a set called my_fav_numbers with all your favorites numbers.
# Add two new numbers to the set.
# Remove the last number.
# Create a set called friend_fav_numbers with your friendâ€™s favorites numbers.
# Concatenate my_fav_numbers and friend_fav_numbers to a new variable called our_fav_numbers.
