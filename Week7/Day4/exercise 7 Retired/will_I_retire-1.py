# Exercise 7: When Will I Retire ?
# Instructions
# The point of the exercise is to check if a person can retire depending on their age and their gender.
# Note : Retirement age in Israel is 67 for men, and 62 for women (born after April, 1947).

# Create a function get_age(year, month, day)
# Hard-code the current year and month in your code (there are better ways of doing this, but for now it will be enough.)
# After calculating the age of a person, the function should return the age (the age is an integer).
# Create a function can_retire(gender, date_of_birth).
# It should call the get_age function (with what arguments?) in order to receive an age.
# Now it has all the information it needs in order to determine if the person with the given gender and date of birth is able to retire or not.
# Calculate. You may need to do a little more hard-coding here.
# Return True if the person can retire, and False if he/she canâ€™t.
